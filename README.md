I am using thi sproject to teach myslef python and to develop easier to use and tools for analysis of songbird and mouse vocalizations.

First stages will be small separate tools to make spectrograms, sort specific wav files into good or bad folders, make batch measurements of fundamental frequency from specific regions of spectrograms.
